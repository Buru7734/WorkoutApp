## Why Work out app:

I was at the gym the day before the proposal was due, and when I got to a particular exercise, I realized that I had forgotten what weight I usually use for it. That’s when I got the idea to create a workout app to help people keep track of their exercises, workouts, and goals.


## Basics:

Hi everyone,

Today I’d like to introduce you to my workout tracking app.

When you first open the app, you’ll land on the login page, where you can either sign in or sign up. Once you're logged in, you're redirected to the Workouts page.

On the Workouts page, you can add a new workout. After adding a workout, there’s an Edit button that takes you to another page where you can rename the workout if needed.

Inside each workout, you can add exercises, including details like the name, sets, reps, and weight. On this same page, you can:

Add more exercises

Edit existing exercises

Delete individual exercises

Or delete the entire workout

In the navigation bar, there’s also a Goals section. This takes you to a separate page where you can:

Choose from one of four preset goals

Set how many days per week you want to work out

Finally, there’s an Account page. Right now, the only feature available there is the option to delete your account, but more features could be added in the future.

## Technologies used:

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Chatgpt, W3School

## Next steps:

My next steps are to complete the Goals section so that users receive personalized recommendations based on the goal they choose.

Additionally, instead of simply entering a number for how many days they want to work out each week, I plan to implement a row of checkboxes for each selected day. This way, users can check off each day they work out. If they complete all their scheduled days by the end of the week, they’ll receive a congratulatory notification to help keep them motivated.

For the Workouts section, I want to improve the user experience by replacing the current text-based selections with images. So when a user clicks a dropdown menu, they’ll see visual options for different workouts. I plan to do the same for the Exercises section as well.
